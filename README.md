 Base Unity Project files for setup with OVR and OpenXR

Open up the "Instructions" folder to find the following files:

1. "Quest-OVR-Setup.pdf" - Contains instructions on how to setup a project for development using Quest 2 and Oculus' OVR SDK
2. "Quest-OpenXR-Setup.pdf" - Contains instructions on how to setup a project for development using Unity, Quest 2, and the OpenXR SDK.
	
Along with it provided are .zip files for all the projects I made using Unity 2020.3.8f1 (last opened in 2021.2.7). These should be named appropriately, and ready to use.
