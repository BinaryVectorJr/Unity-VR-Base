# Unity-VR-Base [COMPLETED]
 Base Unity Project files for setup with OVR and OpenXR. Created the instructions to help undergraduate students in my Professor's class; feel free to use the steps for quick and easy setup.

Open up the "Instructions" folder to find the following files:

1. "Quest-OVR-Setup.pdf" - Contains instructions on how to setup a project for development using Unity, Quest 2 and Oculus' OVR SDK

2. "Quest-OpenXR-Setup.pdf" - Contains instructions on how to setup a project for development using Unity, Quest 2, and the OpenXR SDK.
